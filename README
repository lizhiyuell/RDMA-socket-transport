This project encapsulates two-sided RDMA transport verbs into socket form. It is originally designed to fit open-source databast Deneva from MIT. You can also adopt it in your own projects.

Way to communicate:
Deploy this project in different machines. Eample codes are in "client.cpp" and "server.cpp". When calling "socket" function, be sure to pass the gid number of your machine.

Besides, to fit Deneva well, the ip address form is specially designed. You must adpot it into the form like "tcp://ip:port" to guarantee correct execution.
